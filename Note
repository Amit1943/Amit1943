Design principles
In the cloud, there are a number of principles that can help you strengthen your workload security:

Implement a strong identity foundation: Implement the principle of least privilege and enforce separation of duties with appropriate authorization for each interaction with your AWS resources. Centralize identity management, and aim to eliminate reliance on long-term static credentials.

Enable traceability: Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time. Integrate log and metric collection with systems to automatically investigate and take action.

Apply security at all layers: Apply a defense in depth approach with multiple security controls. Apply to all layers (for example, edge of network, VPC, load balancing, every instance and compute service, operating system, application, and code).

Automate security best practices: Automated software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and cost-effectively. Create secure architectures, including the implementation of controls that are defined and managed as code in version-controlled templates.

Protect data in transit and at rest: Classify your data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption, tokenization, and access control where appropriate.

Keep people away from data: Use mechanisms and tools to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This reduces the risk of mishandling or modification and human error when handling sensitive data.

Prepare for security events: Prepare for an incident by having incident management and investigation policy and processes that align to your organizational requirements. Run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery.

Definition
Security in the cloud is composed of six areas:

Foundations
Identity and access management
Detection
Infrastructure protection
Data protection
Incident response

 Have you used File adapter? where should we use FTP adapter and where to use file adapter?
 Technical flow behind connectivity agent? -- basically need to know how it is different from VPN and IP processing system
 
 Risk Analysis and mitigation plan


such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM),
AWS CloudTrail, AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS),
AWS WAF, Amazon GuardDuty, and AWS Security Hub are
As just one example, using Amazon Inspector and AWS Systems Manager helps customers
automate patching for infrastructure and applications, reducing the burden of manually patching, easing
the process of patching multiple operating systems, and boosting customer productivity
Machine learning and artificial intelligence will add a critical layer of automation to
cloud security
AWS services like Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Detective,
Amazon CodeGuru, and Amazon Macie will continue to lay the groundwork for integration of security and
machine learning, helping customers with intelligent recommendations, at scale
